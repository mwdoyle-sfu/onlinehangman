    <p>How to Play</p>
    <p>
        One player thinks of a word or phrase; the others try to guess what it is one letter at a time. The player draws a
        number of dashes equivalent to the number of letters in the word. If a guessing player suggests a letter that occurs
        in the word, the other player fills in the blanks with that letter in the right places. If the word does not contain
        the suggested letter, the other player draws one element of a hangman’s gallows. As the game progresses, a segment of
        the gallows and of a victim is added for every suggested letter not in the word. The number of incorrect guesses before
        the game ends is up to the players, but completing a character in a noose provides a minimum of six wrong answers until
        the game ends. The first player to guess the correct answer thinks of the word for the next game.
